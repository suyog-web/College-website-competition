&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Dr B. R. Ambedkar (Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar) popularly known as Babasaheb was born in so called untouchable caste family of Mahar. 
But for him this was not the shackle to reach at zenith. He became a great teacher, orator, philosopher, leader and earned many more laurels of this kind. 
Also he was first from his caste to get college education in India, as untouchables were not allowed to get education, they were not allowed to worship in temples, they were not allowed to drink water from the source that was used by upper caste people etc. 
So even while studying in school he had faced all such discriminations. But with a true spirit of a fighter after completing his studies in India, he went to London School of Economics for further studies and became a great lawyer. 
He is a true example of a self made man who worked so hard against all the odds to achieve his goal. Close to his end he adopted Buddhism for wisdom, morality and to protect humanity. 
Also he discovered that Mahar people were actually Buddhist who refused to give up Buddhism at one point of time.
 Because of this, they were forced to live outside the village and with time they became an untouchable caste. He also wrote a book named – ‘The Buddha and His Dhamma’.

<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp  As Babasahed was from an untouchable caste so he knew what it feels when people discriminate you without any fault of yours.
 He did a great job in removing such social issues in India. Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha was the first organized attempt from his side to uplift the untouchables. 
He wanted to educate them for a better life. After this many public movements and marches had been initiated under his leadership that were meant to bring equality in the society.

He was elected as a first law minister of independent India and appointed as a Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. His role was to write a new Constitution for India. 
By keeping in mind to bring equality in society he did great for untouchables. For this, freedom of religion was defined the Constitution. 
He created the system of reservation by keeping in mind untouchable and their condition in that India. He worked for the improvement of the status of women in India.

Not only this, but formation of the Reserve Bank of India in 1934 was also based on the ideas of Babasahed that he had presented to the Hilton Young Commission. 
He was a trained economist of his time and even written very intellectual books on economics. Amartya Sen who is a Nobel Prize winner in economics had said that Ambedkar is his father in economics.

<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Dr B. R. Ambedkar was truly a builder of a nation and a global leader instead of just a Dalit leader. He is the one who had given the principles of social justice.

Babasahed is one of those who had built India in her initial days. They fought to free India and then tried to build India of their dreams. 
To remember this great man, Ambedkar Jayanti is celebrated all across the country especially by the one who follow him. 
Today India needs greater leaders like him to compete and stay ahead at global level.
