<font color="blue" size="5">A SOCIALOGIST FOR SOCIAL REFORM :</font><br><font size="4">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. B. R. Ambedkar being hailed as an economist, socialist and political critic is also a good sociologist
  and a social reformer. He contributed much to the discussions of various social problems.
                His first writing on casteappeared in a paper which he read before the Anthropology seminar 
   (May 9, 1920) of Dr. A. A. Goldenseiser, Columbia University, New York.5 He wrote on ‘caste in India’
   their mechanism, Genesis and Development’ published in Indian Antiquary.
                 He wrote two books about ‘sudras and untouchables’.
                 Besides these books he wrote one booklet, Annihilation of caste, with a reply to Mahatma Gandhi’ 
     (undelivered address before the annual conference of Jat – Pat – Todakmandal, Lahore, 1936.)
   6In his analysis of social problems Ambedkar characterized caste system as irrational and tyrannical. 
  He said that the Hindu scripture which prescribed the untouchables were almost entirely the creation of the
  Brahmins, whose sole object was to sustain their superiority and privileges and hence these sastras must be prescribed.

<font color="blue" size="5">A CRITIC OF MAJORITY AND MINORITY :</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. B. R. Ambedkar bitterly criticized the supremacy of the communal majority over caste minority.
 In India, the majority is a communal majority.
 Writing about this quandary he says, ‘no matter what social and political programme it may have, 
the majority will retain its character of being communal majority.
 The British type of executive will make the minority community a subject race.
 Such a state of affairs cannot be called democracy.
 It will have to be called asd imperialism. Ambedkar asked; ‘what would be swaraj to the untouchables?
 In addition to the hostile administration, there would be an indifferent legislature and a callous executive.
 So, under swaraj the untouchables would have no way to escape from the destiny of degradation which Hindus 
and Hinduism had fixed for them8. The form of executive suggested by Ambedkar to liberate the caste minority is:
<br>
1) To prevent the majority from forming the government without giving the opportunity to the minority to have a
     say in the matter.<br>
2) To prevent the majority from having exclusive control over administration and thereby make the tyranny of the 
     majority over the minority.<br>
3) To prevent the inclusion of the majority party in the executive of the representatives of the minorities who have
     no confidence of the minorities.<br>
4) To provide a stable executive necessary for good and efficient administration. Finally, he suggested the appointment
    of an officer to be called Superintendent of minority affairs.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambedkar while commenting on class structure stated that the recognition of the class structure of society a 
     ‘undemocratic and unrealistic’.
    He denounced the sanctity of the class structure of the society.
   He remarked, ‘the isolation and exclusiveness following upon the class structure creates in the privileged classes
   the anti-social spirit of a gang’.
   10 Under these sorry state of affairs Ambedkar considered it to be the mission of his life to promote a social 
   movement which would transform the entire social structure and liberate the depressed masses in India.
   The character of his social movement as an instrument of social change took the form of challenge, 
   protest confrontation, aggression and revolt. 
   Ambedkar, unlike others, structured his movement upon a critical, historical and scientific study of the problems 
  of the depressed classes.
   He was not only a visionary but also a revolutionary of his age. 
  Restoration of the dignity of man and his right to equality was his consuming passion. 
  He in his mission, rejected all that opposed to his social goal of restoring the dignity of man and accepted what was 
  conducive to the attainment of this social ideal. 
 When he started his march towards this ideal he found that Hindu religion with its social traditions
  which were highly orthodox was the main hindrance. 
 He first accepted to reform the Hindu religion and tradition but were found to be in palatable and hence he was
  left with no alternative but to leave Hinduism and embraced Buddhism.

<font color="blue" size="5">AMBEDKAR AND CONSTITUTION MAKING :</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While examining the role of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in the making of the Indian constitution, one has to take onto account
 his toe distinct and different capacities i.e.<br>
 1) as champion of the untouchables and <br>
2) as a constitutional expert and chairman of the Drafting committee.12 His entering into the Constituent  Assembly opened up new vistas for putting his talents at the disposal of the nation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   He strove his utmost to incorporate into the constitution such provisions as would help establish a new 
     social order based on the lofty principle of political, social and economic justice for not only the depressed 
     classes but to one and all. Specifically, whenever a question of untouchables and the downtrodden come up,
      his heart would flow out for them in full measure. 
     He would go to any length to rehabilitate them and get them maximum political advantage and protection for them.
 But as a great constitutional expert, he was playing his role as a great constitutional expert.
 While speaking to the question of reservation of seats to scheduled castes he said, ‘the reservation of seats
 for scheduled castes is for 10 years only. But I want this reservation should remain for such time as untouchability
 is there’. 
    It is he who demanded that the depressed classes should be regarded for electoral purpose as a separate 
community.
 He demanded common citizenship, free use of common rights and adequate representation in the legislatures,
  government services and in the cabinet. 
   Dr. Ambedkar united the untouchables, raised them to level of human beings and put them on the social and political
  map of India.
 He wanted that all the depressed classes must take initiative in formulating their own plans and programmes of multi
 –faceted development.
  His strategy required that the scheduled castes people should come together and give a united 
fight for their social liberation.
 Dr. Ambedkar was however, sadly frustrated by the attitude of his followers who after receiving higher education
 engaged themselves in selfish pursuits. He observed, ‘The educated, highly educated class (from dalits) have betrayed
 me.
 I have expected that after acquiring education, they will serve the society. But I see here a crowded clerks who are 
engaged in feeding their own stomach.’
(March 18, 1956 at Romilla ground, Agra.) Keeping in view the above Dr. Ambedkar, ashis last message cautioned 
the pseudo – champions of downtrodden :<br>
<font color="blue">I COULD CARRY ON THE CARAVAN AND IF YOU COULD CARRY
 IT FORWARD ALRIGHT? OTHERWISE KEEP IT THERE WHERE I PUT. DON’T PULL IT BACK’. </font><br>
<b></i>Today, Dr. Ambedkar is loved by all those who love untouchables and hate untouchability. </b></i></font>
