&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty nine years back on 6 December 1956 Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar attained ‘Mahaparinirvan’. Born on 14th April 1891, in the military town Mhow, he was the fourteenth child of his parents. Parents from untouchable community viz. Mahar, his father was a retired army officer and headmaster in a military school, and his mother an illiterate woman. Since he was born in an untouchable caste, he was made to sit separate from other students in a corner of the classroom. Despite all kinds of humiliations, he passed his high school in 1908 with flying colours. This was such an exceptional achievement for an untouchable, that he was felicitated in a public meeting.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four years later he graduated in Political Science and Economics from Bombay University. After his graduation he went to the USA to study economics at the Columbia University with a scholarship form the Maharaja of Baroda. Bhimrao remained abroad from 1913 to 1917 and again from 1920 to 1923. In the meantime he had established himself as an eminent intellect.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia University had awarded him the PhD for his thesis, which was later published in a book form under the title “The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India”. But his first published article was “Castes in India – Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development”. In 1920 he went to London where he got his Bar-at-Law at Gray’s Inn for Law. During his sojourn in London from 1920 to 1923, he also completed his thesis titled “The Problem of the Rupee” for which he was awarded the degree of DSc.<br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp  During the brief stay in India from 1917 to 1920 he first got a job as Military Secretary in Baroda Raja’s office. Here he was ill treated again by the upper caste employees. Even drinking water was not given to him and files were kept at a distance from him. He couldn’t continue in Baroda and later taught at Sydnom College in Bombay and also brought out Marathi weekly whose title was ‘Mook Nayak’ (meaning ‘Dumb Hero’). He had to face similar experience of untouchability and dishonour even in Bombay.  While coming back to India in 1923, Ambedkar again experienced humiliation. The upper caste lawyers would not even have tea at his desk. But his greatest consolation was his clients, whom he treated with liberal mind. His reputation and fame among the Depressed Classes began to grow. He visualised and struggled for a casteless and equal India.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he returned to India, Bhimrao had equipped himself fully to wage war against the practice of untouchability. In 1924 he started the organisation ‘Bahiskrit Hitakarini Sabha’ (Outcastes Welfare Association), for the upliftment of the untouchables. Ambedkar adopted a two-pronged strategy. First, the eradication of illiteracy and economic uplift of the downtrodden and second, initiating non-violent struggle against visible symbols of casteism, like denial of entry into temples and drawing water from public wells and tanks.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of the downtrodden were centuries old and difficult to overcome. Their entry into temples was forbidden. They could not draw water from public wells and ponds. Their admission in schools was prohibited. Ambedkar won two major victories when the High Court of Bombay gave a verdict in favour of the untouchables. On 25th December 1927, he led the Mahad March at the Chowdar Tank at Colaba, near Bombay, to ensure the untouchables right to draw water from the public tank. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marchers were met with the brutality of caste Hindus. He then burnt copies of the ‘Manusmriti’ publicly terming it a document of discrimination with a number of his supporters. It was an act of great courage to do so in the den of violent Chitpawan Brahmins in Maharastra. The two struggles shook the religious foundation on which the caste system is built. This marked the beginning of the anti-caste and ant-priest movement in Maharastra. The temple entry movement launched by Dr. Ambedkar in 1930 at Kalaram temple, Nasik is another landmark in the struggle for human rights and social justice. He was fully convinced that nothing could emancipate the Dalits except through a complete destruction of the caste system. He continued his movement to attack the base of caste system in every possible way.<br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Simon Commission visited India and Dr. Ambedkar met the commission in Pune in which Ambedkar presented his position on depressed classes. He then followed it up during the round table conference after which Ramsay McDonald? announced ‘Communal Award’ as a result of which several communities including the ‘depressed classes’ were given the right to have separate electorates. Gandhiji wanted to defeat this design and went on a fast unto death to oppose it. On 24th September 1932, Ambedkar and Gandhiji reached an understanding, which became the famous Poona Pact. According to this Pact, in addition to the agreement on electoral constituencies, reservations were provided for untouchables in Government jobs and legislative assemblies. The Pact carved out a clear and definite position for the downtrodden on the political scene of the country. For the first time in Indian history it opened up opportunities of education and government service for them and also gave them a right to vote.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Ambedkar attended all the three Round Table Conferences in London and each time, forcefully projected his views in the interest of the ‘untouchable’. He exhorted the downtrodden sections to raise their living standards and to acquire as much political power as possible. He was of the view that there was no future for untouchables in the Hindu religion and they should change their religion if need be. In 1935, he publicly proclaimed,” I was born a Hindu because I had no control over this but I shall not die a Hindu”.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
