Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar popularly known as Babasaheb, was an Indian jurist, politician and social reformer who inspired the Modern Buddhist Movement and campaigned against social discrimination in India, 
striving for equal social rights for Dalits, women and labour. 
He was independent India's first law minister and the principal architect of the Constitution of India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning a law degree and various doctorates from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science. 
In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities, 
where he became involved in the negotiations for India's independence campaigning by publishing journals advocating political rights and social freedom for untouchables and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.
 In 1956 he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits. 

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bhimrao Ambedkar was appointed as the chairman of the constitution drafting committee. He was also a noted scholar and eminent jurist. Ambedkar emphasized on the construction of a virtual bridge between the classes of the society. According to him,
 it would be difficult to maintain the unity of the country if the difference among the classes were not met.
