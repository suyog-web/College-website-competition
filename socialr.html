&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoration of the dignity of man and his right to equality was his consuming passion.
 He in his mission, rejected all that opposed to his social goal of restoring the dignity of man
 and accepted what was conducive to the attainment of this social ideal.
                 When he started his march towards this ideal he found that Hindu religion with its social
 traditions which were highly orthodox was the main hindrance. 
        He first accepted to reform the Hindu religion and tradition but were found to be in palatable 
and hence he was left with no alternative but to leave Hinduism and embraced Buddhism.
            Among the galaxy of social reformers and philosophers in India,<font color="blue">BharathaRatna
 Dr. BhimraoRamji Ambedkar</font>, reverentially and most affectionately called <font color="blue">‘Babasaheb Ambedkar’ </font>
occupies a prominent place in the annals of India’s social history. 
                       He is the multi-dimensional personality blessed with historical vision.
         He is worshipped as the darling of depressed masses and the touchable god of untouchables.
    He victoriously championed the cause of dalit emancipation and emanated as the dedicated
 protagonist of weaker sections. His bitter experience as a born untouchable,
 progressive western liberal education, extensive reading and research, wide mass contacts
 provided him with the required perspective, theoretical frame and the depth and dimension
 for understanding and subjecting to a critical analysis any problem – be it social, political or economic.
<br><br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He was a rare blend of a scholar,thinker, writer, legal luminary, constitutional expert, champion of the
 down trodden, a great emancipator and above all a committed humanist.
 He became the driving force of prosperity, perennial fountain of inspiration and a haven of hope for the 
untouchables.
    As an active politician and serious mindedsocial reformer, Dr.Ambedkar knowing his limitations and fully aware
 of social hazards and more particularly helplessness of historically oppressed and suppressed sections of Indian society, 
vigorously worked hard to uplift these masses.
 He should for human unity, freedom, simplicity, integrity, liberty, equality, social and economic justice. 
   In fact, to emancipate the downtrodden, who had been subjected under economic exploitation, social subjugation 
and political bondage by tiny but most powerful social groups it certainly wasn’t an easy task.
 Still as an intellectual giant Dr. Ambedkar is in more pragmatic manner attempted although not fundamentally
 challenging the existing exploitative system, with in the parliamentary frame, to ameliorate this deprived sections 
and provide them just place in the society.
                 While drafting the Indian constitution, Dr. Ambedkar used his pen, incorporating philosophical tenets in
 the preamble and various other provisions in the Indian Constitution to remove the social injustice.
        For example, Art. 38 was incorporated to remove the economical inequality, Art. 45 was inserted to destroy 
the curse of illiteracy and ignorance, Art. 38 and 39 were to eliminate exploitation of man by man, Art.31 (A) was
 intended to abolish feudal over lordship; and Art. 
                17 was added to abolish untouchability which was the curse in the Indian society.
<br><br>
<font color="blue" size="5">CHAMPION OF HUMAN RIGHTS:</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dr. Ambedkar fought for the cause of human rights for the wellbeing of all in the society.
 He conceived the state as an organization the aim of which was :
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>* To maintain the right of every subject to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness and to free speech
    and free exercise of religion.</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>* To remove social, political and economic inequality by providing better opportunities to the submerged classes.</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>* To make it possible for every subject to enjoy freedom from fear.</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To his certain political rights alone he did not constitute the basis of democracy.
 Sociability and morality were the important elements of his concept of democracy. 
Liberty, equality, fraternity, region, human experience, the rule of law, natural rights and an emphasis
    on the individual in social relationships formed the fundamental elements of his concept of democracy.
 His faith in individual liberty and dignity laid him to the rule of law.

<font color="blue" size="5">A SOCIALIST FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED:</font><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dr. B. R. Ambedkar supported the progressive steps of <b>Socialism</b>.
   He thought that its practical application would facilitate the solution of the problem 
  of the underprivileged.
                 His burning desire for securing social, economic and political justice to the 
   underprivileged class is quite evident in his brainwork of Indian constitution.
                He made the Indian constitution itself a socialistic. When K.T. Shah tabled
   an amendment to the first article of the constitution, read ‘India shall be a secular,
   federal, socialist union of states’ Ambedkar said that the amendment is superfluous.
  ‘If these Directive Principles are not socialistic in their direction and in their content,
 I fail to understand what more socialism can be’.
 These socialistic principles are already embodied in our constitution.
                According to him, caste – consciousness hampers all economic growth. 
      It creates conditions which are harmful for collective efforts in agriculture and other activities.
     Rural development in the presence of caste relations would be against the principles of socialism.  
     Therefore,the great feudal estates based on casteism must be broken up and the land be distributed
 to the people who till it and who can collectively produce things for the rapid progress of both cities and villages.
