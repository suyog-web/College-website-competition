<font color="blue" size="5"><i>Controversy :</i></font><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After laying of foundation stone event of memorial, Ambedkar's family (Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's grandsons Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar and Anandraj Ambedkar) and Maharashtra Ambedkarities leaders were not satisfied with memorial design. Some had concerns over the practical details of the design while others thought the memorial was not befitting the stature of Dr. Ambedkar. Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar pressed for memorial to have a “think tank institution”, an intellectual centre of international standards for scholars across the globe come for intellectual activity as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was an intellectual giant who contributed to many fields different many ways. Anandraj Ambedkar also suggested a design to the State government which was not considered as his design consisted of a 360-feet tall statue of Dr. Ambedkar, Statue of Equality. The design right now looks more like a joggers’ park than a memorial. Leaders demanded government to set up a technical committee of experts on Buddhism, reputed architects from different Buddhist countries, and well-known people from the construction industry before finalising the memorial’s design with inclusion of a State of Equality (a larger-than-life sculpture of Ambedkar facing the ocean like the New York City’s Statue of Liberty) so to form an impressive part of Mumbai’s skyline and should be the first thing that visitors landing in Mumbai lay their eyes on.
