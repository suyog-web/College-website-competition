<li> Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.</li><br><br>
<li> A great man is different from an eminent one in that he is ready to be the servant of the society.</li><br><br>
<li>History shows that where ethics and economics come in conflict, victory is always with economics.</li><br><br>
<li> Vested interests have never been known to have willingly divested themselves unless there was sufficient 
         force to compel them.</li><br><br>
<li> For a successful revolution it is not enough that there is discontent.
    What is required is a profound and thorough conviction of the justice, necessity and importance of political
     and social rights.</li><br><br><br>
<li> What are we having this liberty for? We are having this liberty in order to reform our social system, which 
      is full of inequality, discrimination and other things, which conflict with our fundamental rights. </li><br><br><br>
<li> In Hinduism, conscience, reason and independent thinking have no scope for development.</li><br><br>
<li> A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based on social ethics.
      No other standard would have any meaning if religion is held to be necessary good for the
      well-being of the people. </li><br><br><br>
<li> So long as you do not achieve social liberty, whatever freedom is provided by the law is of no avail to you.</li><br><br>
 <li>We are Indians, firstly and lastly.</li><br><br>
<li>Indians today are governed by two different ideologies.
    Their political ideal set in the preamble of the Constitution affirms a life of liberty, equality and fraternity.
    Their social ideal embodied in their religion denies them.</li> <br><br><br>
<li> The sovereignty of scriptures of all religions must come to an end if we want to have a united integrated
     modern India.</li> <br><br>
  <li>I like the religion that teaches liberty, equality and fraternity.</li><br><br>
<li> Religion must mainly be a matter of principles only.
 It cannot be a matter of rules.
 The moment it degenerates into rules, it ceases to be a religion,
 as it kills responsibility which is an essence of the true religious act.</li><br><br><br>
<li> Life should be great rather than long.</li></ol><br><br><br>
